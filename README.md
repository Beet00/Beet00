- 👋 Hi, I’m @Beet00
- 👀 I’m interested in playing/creating videogames, reading(mostly comics, but i'm open to suggestions) and listening to music(any kind is fine).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to properly be a Game Designer! I'm in my 3rd year(out of 3) at the International School of Comics in Florence, Italy, where they're teaching me 
how to be one, so i hope i'll find a dev team that's interested in a novice who really wants to learn!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project, really. I just hope to find a studio that'll let me in to properly get some experience in the game developement world
that isn't school related as i already said.
- 📫 How to reach me: masteralex00@gmail.com
